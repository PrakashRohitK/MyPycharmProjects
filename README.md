Note on Uploaded Files:
1)Some projects could not be uploaded entirely due to large file sizes. I plan to provide alternative access for these files in 
the future. 
2)Several uploaded files may include older packages or code snippets that could be deprecated. They are uploaded primarily for educational 
purposes, to demonstrate how the code functions and the logic behind the implementations. Please feel free to send suggestions and alternatives to improve my project code

Some scripts may require older versions of certain libraries. Check the script comments for required packages.
